# Blooming


Our project aims to address the issue where many women, particularly young girls, lack sufficient information about their bodies and their health, along with the necessary tools to maintain their well-being. Adding to this challenge, there is widespread negative stigma and harmful stereotypes surrounding female reproductive health, significantly impacting girls and women. The problem is particularly pronounced among women of marginalized identities whose cultures have a stigma around female reproductive health, and women with limited access to information.

The audience we seek to support includes young girls, women from marginalized identities whose cultures have a stigma around female reproductive health, and those with limited access to the necessary information and tools to maintain their health. Our website, Blooming, will provide our target users with comprehensive knowledge about their bodies, health, and well-being. Successfully addressing this problem would result in increased awareness and understanding of female reproductive health among the target audience.
