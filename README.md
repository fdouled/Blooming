# Blooming


Our project aims to address the issue where many women, particularly young girls, lack sufficient information about their bodies and their health, along with the necessary tools to maintain their well-being. Adding to this challenge, there is widespread negative stigma and harmful stereotypes surrounding female reproductive health, significantly impacting girls and women. The problem is particularly pronounced among women of marginalized identities whose cultures have a stigma around female reproductive health, and women with limited access to information.

The audience we seek to support includes young girls, women from marginalized identities whose cultures have a stigma around female reproductive health, and those with limited access to the necessary information and tools to maintain their health. Our website, Blooming, will provide our target users with comprehensive knowledge about their bodies, health, and well-being. Successfully addressing this problem would result in increased awareness and understanding of female reproductive health among the target audience.

## Current Status
We have created three basic learning modules and quizzes for users to explore and test their knowledge. As of right now, user authentication has been implemented into the website, but module progress and quiz scores cannot be saved.

## Continuing the project
For the future, having a wider library of modules and quizzes to choose from is the top priority. The web app should also include different kinds of questions for quizzes and gamifying the experience to encourage more learning. To make it more accessible to wider audience, we would like for there to be the possibility of changing the displayed language on the website to stay true to our original goal of providing a resource for those of marginalized identites.
