# Handoff/Closeout Documentation 
To make edits to our code in the future, there are some steps you must take to move the code to your machine and make edits to the code files. 
- The first step is to have your team lead fork the GitHub repository to their GitHub account and add the rest of the team as collaborators. 
- Once everyone has been added to the repo, you may clone it to your computers using Terminal (for Mac) or “bash”( for Windows).
- Get the SSH or HTTPS url from the GitHub page. It can be found when you click the green  (< > Code) button. 
- Once you have copied the SSH or HTTPS url, open Terminal to create a folder for the project. 
- Here are the steps to  clone the repo to your personal computer:
  - Use the git clone command and paste in the  SSH or HTML url (git@github.com:fdouled/Blooming.git) 
- Once you run the command in Terminal, you should have access to the code files to make edits.
